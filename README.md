**Approach,**
The design and development of this travel app UI were guided by the following objectives:

1) User-Centric Design: I aimed to create a seamless, easy-to-navigate interface, prioritizing accessibility and simplicity.
2) Flutter Framework: I chose Flutter for this project because of its flexibility, hot reload feature, and ability to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
3) UI Components: The app includes essential UI elements such as:
    a> Home page with featured destinations
    b> Travel package cards

**Challenges Faced**
Throughout the development of the app UI, I encountered several challenges:

1) Complex Layouts: Designing a responsive layout that adapts well across different screen sizes was tricky.
2) Custom Widgets: Creating custom widgets, posed a challenge in terms of performance and smooth rendering.
3) Design Language: Ensuring that the app has consistent styling, such as color schemes, typography, and padding across different screens, was a challenge.


**Improvements I Would Make**
1) Support for user authentication.
2) Improved performance.
3) Currently, the app UI is static. In the future, I would integrate a backend service.
